**40. The Concept of "Composition" ("children props")
here we are creating wrapper for cards for applying css -- it is one of the pattern
**

**59. Child-to-Parent Component Communication (Bottom-up)
parent child pattern**

**60. Lifting The State Up
when the state is used by sibiling node and its children**

```console
61. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components & Stateless vs Stateful Components
here there is passing of data from child to parent using props.function adn setting value in parent

and passing of data from parent to child using 2 way data binding in value in child component but using props of parent compionent (eg

<ExpensesFilter selected={filteredYear}>  in child component which is used in <Expenses> - parent componet (all logic is poresent in this parent and callled controlled component)

this prop is receive in child component in <select value={props.selected}>
```

```json
65. Using Stateful Lists
not a correct way to set the expenses, we will use prev statte snapshot

```
